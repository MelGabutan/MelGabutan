				World of Dance Philippines

			<h4>
				The Exporters | 2018 - 2019 Contender
			</h4> 
			<p>
				In July 2019, The Exporters was selected to be one of the contenders of World of Dance 
				Philippines. 
				<br>
				<br>
				It was a dream come true for me and my crew because being seen in TV is an opportunity that knocks only once. Here's a quick introduction in order to know more about our crew.	The Exporters is a team that is composed of young and talented choreographers exported from the different dance crews in Cebu City, who joined forces together to form one group called, "The Exporters". 
				<br>
				<br>
				The Exporters is well-known to have a unique dance style which produces pieces that tells a story rather than just dancing alone. This is why World of Dance PH is a great opportunity for us to showcase our talents and spread awareness of social and political issues.
				<br>
				<br>
				World of Dance Philippines is a reality competition television series aired by ABS-CBN where
				several contestants gets to showcase their dancing skills to impress the judges in an attempt to win the title and the grand prize.
				<br>
				<br>
				The competition was composed of different stages. First, "The Qualifiers", this is the stage where the contestants need to reach a score of 85 and above to proceed to the next level. Fortunately, we scored a whooping 90 and successfully touched the audience with our piece. The piece was all about bullying which was connected to the life story of our founder, Ryan Canda. Our piece was posted in YouTube and had a million views.

				The second stage was called "The Duels", the name of the stage alone explains the how the stage will be played. There will be two teams who will compete against each other, the team who gets a higher score may proceed to the next level. 
				<br><br>
				We were paired with "Foxy Ladies", a team which had a different dance style. This was a hard time for us because judging will be a matter of personal preference. Fortunately we won the duels and got to proceed to the next round.

				The Cut: the third stage of World of Dance PH where the show will only pick the top 3 contenders per category and these contenders will get to clash in the semi finals. This was the end to our journey, we didn't make it to the top 3.
				<br>
				<br>
				It was one of the best experience in my whole life where I get to balance out my studies and my passion. Although we did not bring home the bacon, we we are still proud to be one of the selected crews to get on that stage.
