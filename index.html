			<h4>The Exporters | 2018 - 2019 Contender</h4> 
			<p>
				In May 2019, I quit my job at Google
				<br><br>
				Why did I leave what was at one point my dream job?
				<br><br>
				During my four years at Google, I had grown increasingly concerned by the downward spiral of American sociopolitics. Social media had become increasingly toxic, our democratic institutions had dramatically eroded, and our elected officials at every level seemed neither willing nor able to get anything done
				<br><br>
				Furthermore, I saw that Generation Z—the generation with the greatest potential to reimagine and rebuild our social and political systems—was not getting the support it needed to unleash that potential.
				<br><br>
				While I had long contemplated breaking what are infamously called Google's "golden handcuffs," it was meeting my eventual Civics Unplugged co-founders that finally gave me the courage to quit my job. They reminded me of something very important.
				<br><br>
				“Democracy can’t wait.”
				<br><br>
				Indeed, if we don't quickly revitalize our democracy, America will sink under the weight of its greatest challenges—including the climate crisis, skyrocketing inequality, and rising geopolitical tensions
				<br><br>
				So how does Civics Unplugged fit into the democracy renewal equation? CU helps channel Gen Z's passion, creativity, and idealism toward reforming and rebuilding American democracy. Over the course of the decade, CU will empower tens of thousands of Gen Z leaders to devote themselves to the cause and inspire millions more supporters.
				<br><br>
				While we are only on year two of our decade-long journey, we are off to a strong start, with partners and supporters like Andrew Yang, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, and National Geographic—who have committed to doing 
				whatever it takes to help our Gen Zers create lasting change and build a brighter future for us all.
